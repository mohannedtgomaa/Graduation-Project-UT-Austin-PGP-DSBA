Title: Falcon Airlines Passengers Satisfaction Classifier

Project Summary:
Falcon Airlines has been recently losing passengers to the competition, due to overall drop in Passengers’ satisfaction of their flights’ services. The Airline has been working to resolve this issue by understanding and mapping out the key factors affecting overall levels of satisfaction and the best means to predict it. 

Project Outcomes:
We were able to narrow down variables from 25 to only six based on their importance to satisfaction prediction and classification; these variables were:
1-	Seat comfort;
2-	Inflight Entrainment;          
3-	Checking-services;
4-	Passenger Class;
5-	Travel type; &
6-	Online support. 
We recommend for the Airlines to use an ensemble leaner models, namely Random forest as it provided an impressive performance with both high accuracy 95%+ and precision 95%+, for predicting and classifying passengers’ satisfaction.
